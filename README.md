# screen-to-world
Converting from screen coordinates + depth buffer to world coordinates, in WebGL / three.js 

The code in this repo shows how you, using a screen coordinate (mouse location) as input can read out a depth buffer value and convert the location + depth buffer value into a 3D world coordinate.
